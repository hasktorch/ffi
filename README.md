# codegen

Parse source files from the [TH][th] library and generate low-level bindings in
Haskell. Warning - these parsers are just "good enough" to process their
intended inputs, not robust enough for general purpose use. TODO: look into
whether [bindings-DSL](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-DSL) might
provide a more robust approach.
